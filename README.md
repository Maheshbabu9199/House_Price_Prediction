House price prediction is a crucial aspect of the real estate market, helping buyers, sellers, and investors make informed decisions. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. Built with Python 3.10 and the Streamlit framework, this project offers an interactive and user-friendly web interface that simplifies the prediction process. The modular code structure ensures scalability and ease of maintenance.

## Features
- Predict house prices using a trained machine learning model.
- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit.
- Modular code structure for ease of maintenance and scalability.
- Detailed visualizations and insights from the model predictions.
